            <p> Summers in Michigan can feel so short compared to what seems like the months of cold and snow. That is why it is so important to take advantage of all the sun while you can! The problem is by the time summer comes around it can feel so overwhelming because of how busy it can get. So here are some tips to maximizing your summer fun!

            <em>Three Steps to an Awesome Summer</em>
            <p>1. Make sure to find some time to relax
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes we get so caught up in summer because we feel like we have so many things we want to do and so many people we want to see but in the midst of all this we forget to take time for ourselves. </p>
            <p>2. Have a list of the activities or goals that are the most important to do</p>
            <p>This doesn't necessarily have to be an actual written list, but knowing your priorities for summer will help you to accomplish the things that are the most important to you.</p>
            <p>3. Don't feel guilty for missing out on something or someone</p>
            <p>Sometimes we get caught up with the fact that we missed out on an opportunity and can be frustrated at ourselves but the reality is not everything is going to happen exactly how we want it to. That being said, focus on all the other amazing opportunities you have been able to do and not the ones that didn't work out.</p>

                Summer usually means getting together with family and friends a lot more, specifically through get togethers and parties. This also means potlucks and dinners where you are typically expected to bring dishes to pass. One of the best ways to do this is bringing a dessert that is easy to make and that everyone will enjoy! One super easy and tasty dessert to make is a trifle. To make this dessert is pretty simple and you can get most ingredients at your local grocery store! Look at the following recipe to start making your next dessert for a fun time with family and friends!

            <p>Lemon Trifle Recipe</p>
            <p>1 lb frozen Sara Lee 16 oz Family size pound cake
                1 Â½ cups milk
                1 8oz. Sour cream
                1 8oz. Cool whip

            </p>
            <p>Cut up cake into cubes. Combine milk and sour cream and 1/2 whipped cream. Mix till smooth and add pudding mix. (Mix it just until thickens). Layer 1/3 cake, 1/3 blueberries and strawberries, 1/3 pudding mix and some whipped cream in whatever container you would like. Repeat this twice and add extra fruit on top.
