            <p> Summers in Michigan can feel so short compared to what seems like the months of cold and snow. That is why it is so important to take advantage of all the sun while you can! The problem is by the time summer comes around it can feel so overwhelming because of how busy it can get. So here are some tips to maximizing your summer fun! 
            </p>
            <h4>Three Steps to an Awesome Summer</h4>
            <p>1. Make sure to find some time to relax
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes we get so caught up in summer because we feel like we have so many things we want to do and so many people we want to see but in the midst of all this we forget to take time for ourselves. </p>
            <p>2. Have a list of the activities or goals that are the most important to do</p>
            <p>This doesn't necessarily have to be an actual written list, but knowing your priorities for summer will help you to accomplish the things that are the most important to you.</p>
            <p>3. Don't feel guilty for missing out on something or someone</p>
            <p>Sometimes we get caught up with the fact that we missed out on an opportunity and can be frustrated at ourselves but the reality is not everything is going to happen exactly how we want it to. That being said, focus on all the other amazing opportunities you have been able to do and not the ones that didn't work out.</p>
