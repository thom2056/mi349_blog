        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Anna Thompson and I am going into my senior year at Michgian State University. I am studying Business Management with a minor in information technology. Currently, I am working as a construction management intern for a company out of Grand Rapids this summer. I was born and raised in Michigan in the town of Greenville near GR. I have one older brother who I am very close with and several close friends who I love to spend time hanging out with. I also have lots of hobbies that I enjoy:

            Some fun facts about me is thet my favorite color is blue, I love ice cream (pretty much any flavor), and I love everything to do with the ocean, lakes, and beaches. My favorite animal is a dolphin. My cousin has two kids that I consider to be my neice and nephew; I  love spending time with them. My favorite place in the world is my grandma's lake where I am able to practice many of the hobbies I love.
